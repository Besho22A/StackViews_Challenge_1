# StackView Practice Challenge

## ðŸ“± Overview
In this challenge, I practiced building a single screen layout using **UIStackView** instead of traditional Auto Layout constraints.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
- How to structure UI using **Stack Views** effectively.
- The power of **nested Stack Views** to create complex layouts in a clean and manageable way.
- How a **parent view** can adapt its height based on the content inside a `UIStackView`, without the need for hardcoded constraints.

## âœ… Key Takeaways
- **StackViews** are much easier and faster for layout than setting up multiple constraints manually.
- Nesting `StackViews` can help in creating advanced UI designs while keeping the code readable.
- It's important to let the stack control the layout instead of trying to force constraints.

## ðŸ§ª Challenge Type
- Single screen layout
- No full app logic â€” just UI building and layout experimentation
